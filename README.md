***
This is an early stage development project, many things may change or be removed, including this README.
***

## Installation

For git SSH cloning you need a RSA Key.
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:Aarhus-BSS/Aarhus-Research.git
```

Next, open the project folder using NetBeans and build (F11). 

Now you have the jar file in the dist/ folder.

## Usage

Run with `java -Xmx1000m -jar AUReseach-Exp.jar`

* You can to use the GUI, easily understandable, to perform the tests.
* Or you can do multiple runs of one preset by putting `library=console` in the options file `options.cfg`.
* Or you can do multiple runs of multiple presets with the python3 script `run_multiple_presets.py`

If you use Java, include all the source files and use RoundManager as starting point.

```java
RoundManager _roundManager = new RoundManager(_numberOfRounds, _numberOfSAgents, _numberOfPAgents);
_roundManager.runRound(); // Single round run.
_roundManager.runLoop(); // All the rounds.
_roundManager.end(); // Write the end of the report files and ends the Matchmaking game.
```

## Using the output

The GUI will plot and export single runs.
If you do multiple runs, you can use the scripts in R/ to plot multiple runs of multiple presets at the same time, based on the data exports.
